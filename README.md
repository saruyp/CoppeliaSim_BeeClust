# CoppeliaSim_BeeClust

This files ware adapted from an user called andrei91ro, that premade the files of controller_vrep.lua(that here was renamed to KilobotController.lua)
and kilobot_vrep.lua(that here was renamed for Kilobot.lua). You can find the original files at https://github.com/andrei91ro/kilolib_vrep.

I'm using them to create a simulation of the algorith BEECLUST, that is an use of the kilobot to simulate the behavior of the bees in contact with some
sorce of light.

changes will be made in the future.
